# Basic LangChain Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic projects demonstrating the capabilities of **LangChain**, a framework for developing applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)**. These projects cover fundamental concepts such as **text translation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory, and AI agents**.

## üöÄ Projects Included

Each project is maintained in a separate **Git branch**. Switch to the respective branch to explore the project.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Text Translation using LangChain**
- Implements a simple **language translation model** using **LangChain and Google Gemini AI**.
- Uses **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** to translate sentences into a specified target language.
- Takes user input for both the sentence and the target language.
- Utilizes **prompt engineering** to dynamically create translation prompts.
- **Branch:** `text-translation`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Implements a **retrieval-based AI system** using LangChain, allowing enhanced responses through external knowledge retrieval.
- The project consists of two main components:
  - **Ingestion Pipeline**: Loads, splits, and embeds text documents using **Hugging Face embeddings** and stores them in a **Pinecone vector database**.
  - **Retrieval System**: Takes user queries, retrieves the most relevant documents using **vector search**, and generates responses using **Google Gemini AI**.
- Uses **LangChain‚Äôs prompt engineering** to structure retrieval-augmented responses.
- Enhances LLM performance by **integrating structured document retrieval**.
- **Branch:** `RAG`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Memory-based Chatbots**
- Implements **different types of conversational memory** to maintain context across interactions.
- **Buffer Memory**: Stores the entire conversation history, enabling the AI to remember all prior exchanges.
- **Buffer Window Memory**: Retains only the last few interactions (configurable window size), balancing memory efficiency with contextual awareness.
- **Summary Buffer Memory**: Summarizes previous conversations into a concise format, maintaining essential details while reducing memory footprint.
- **Summary Memory**: Generates structured conversation summaries for long-term retention, ensuring context without requiring full history.
- Uses **LangChain‚Äôs memory components** with **Google Gemini AI** to create dynamic and context-aware chatbots.
- **Branch:** `memory-chatbot`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Agents using LangChain**
- Develops **autonomous agents** capable of reasoning and decision-making.
- Utilizes **LangChain's Agent framework** for handling dynamic tasks.
- Implements various tools to perform specific operations, such as string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and frequency analysis.
- The system allows **easy integration of additional agents** for expanding capabilities.
- Uses **LangChain‚Äôs prompt engineering** to guide decision-making processes and determine the best tool for each query.
- **Branch:** `AI-agents`
